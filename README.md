# Hangman
This is the last project of the course Object-Oriented Programming where you have to develop the game of the Hangman in Eclipse. The program works the following way, if you choose the option 1, it automatically reads'WordList.txt' that I have added to the file and the guesses are 10 then if you want to select another file, you choose option 2 and there, you can change the file, the number of guesses or both and after those changes, it automatically displays the game.
